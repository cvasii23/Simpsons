Itchy waits impatiently, then, fed up\nwith the delay, grabs an axe and chops the cat into pieces.\n\n \n\nItchy introduces Scratchy to a female cat, obviously constructed from\ndynamite and a bowling ball.  Scratchy goes gaga, sidles up, and\nplants a kiss on the ersatz-feline.  The cat detonates.  Among the\nbody parts that remain are Itchy\'s eyes (still blinking) and a romance\nheart slowly wafting down.\n\n \n\nItchy slams a film camera into the back of Scratchy\'s neck.\nScratchy\'s head falls off and blood spurts out.\n\n \n\nProto-Scratchy walks down the street, happily whistling a tune.\nScratchy is wearing a hat, has gloves on his paws, and generally looks\nabsolutely nothing like the modern Scratchy.\n\n \n\nItchy (visually indistinguishable from the early Mickey Mouse)\ncheerfully pilots a steamboat down the river.  Scratchy joins him, and\nall is blissful.  Itchy suddenly reaches down, pulls out a machine\ngun, and shoots off Scratchy\'s kneecaps.  Scratchy falls to his knees\nand crawls around in pain with his eyes closed.  Itchy politely opens\nthe furnace grate, as Scratchy (trailing blood) crawls into it.  Itchy\nkicks Scratchy in the butt and slams the grate shut to secure the\ncat\'s fate.  Itchy laughs as the cat\'s body writhes in agony.  After a\nsuitable amount of time, Itchy opens the grate and pulls out\nScratchy\'s head, which has burnt to a crisp.  Itchy says, ``Oh me, oh my!\'\'\n\n \n\nItchy and Scratchy have the Tom and Jerry look and feel.  Adolf Hitler\ngives his salute, and the cat and mouse proceed to pummel him,\nScratchy with a mallet, Itchy with a log, Scratchy with a giant\nwrench, and Itchy gives the final blow, decapitating the F\\"uhrer with\nan axe.  Sousa\'s ``Stars and Stripes Forever\'\' continues to play as\nthe cat and mouse shake hands, then Itchy chops off Scratchy\'s head.\nThe classic tongue comes out.  A cartoon Roosevelt dances on-screen\n(the music changes to ``Happy Days Are Here Again\'\') and kicks what\'s\nleft of Hitler and Scratchy in the rear end.  Itchy holds a sign,\n``Save Scrap Iron\'\'.\n\n \n\nThe standard intro sequence, except ``The Itchy and Scratchy Show\'\'\nchanges to ``The Itchy and Scratchy Movie\'\'.  Itchy ties Scratchy to\nthe railroad tracks and runs for a waiting train.  But the train\nengineer won\'t let Itchy into the engine car.  So Itchy enrols in\nEngineer School.  ``The Big Book of Trains\'\' and ``The Civil\nEngineer\'\' are the texts.  (Does ``The Civil Engineer\'\' explain how to\nstick out your pinky while drawing diagrams?)  Itchy receives his\ndiploma, tosses his cap into the air, hangs his diploma on the wall\n(between pictures of his parents), admires it briefly, then rushes to\na Union Pacific office, fills the ``Engineer Wanted\'\' position, and\nhops into the engine of the train.  By this time, Scratchy has nearly\nextricated himself, but alas not quite in time.  After the train runs\nhim over, all that\'s left of the cat are his arms and the leg still\ntied to the tracks.\n\nDidja notice...  the mouse hole in Itchy\'s wainscotting!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    [Nazis on Tap]  I dare you to make Hitler funny.\n\n \n\nSoylent Green is the title of a movie set in an overpopulated 21st\ncentury.  To feed the masses, the government provides a foodstuff\ncalled ``soylent green\'\'.  At the end of the movie, Charlton Heston\ndiscovers that soylent green is made of people.\n\nEthan Miller @{elm} points out that in the original book, ``Make Room,\nMake Room\'\' by Harry Harrison, soylent green was made of <soy>beans\nand <lent>ils.  Only in the movie version were the ingredients sinister.\n\n \n\nBlah blah.\n\n'
